## 🛠️ Technical Showcase: Animated Portfolio & Engineering Background

An interactive, performance-optimized portfolio built with a focus on high-fidelity animations and modern frontend architecture.

### 🏗️ Core Project Stack
* **Templating & Logic:** Pug (Jade) & Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Backend & Routing:** Express.js & Node.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap (**Mobile-First Responsive Design**)
* **Animation Engine:** GSAP (TweenMax) for high-performance scroll-driven transitions
* **State & Persistence:** LocalStorage for user preference and performance caching

### ✨ Key Engineering Features
* **Performance Optimization:** Leveraged WebP image formats and lazy-loading to ensure high Core Web Vitals scores.
* **Complex Animations:** Integrated GSAP for scroll-triggered heading reveals and dynamic, fading paw-trail effects.
* **SEO & Analytics:** Integrated Google Analytics for user engagement tracking and search engine optimization.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Built with semantic HTML5, high-contrast color ratios, and ARIA labels for screen-reader compatibility.

### 🕹️ Logic & Game Development Experience
* **Game Engines:** Built **Tetris** and **Tic Tac Toe** using Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation.
* **State Logic:** Developed a **Simon Game** using jQuery to handle complex sequence tracking and user input validation.
* **API Integration:** Engineered applications using **AJAX** and **JSON** to fetch and render dynamic data from external APIs.
* **Legacy & Frameworks:** Built functional tools (e.g., **Calculator**) using **Angular 1.3**, demonstrating adaptability across different library versions.

### 🔧 Professional Tools & Workflow
* **Version Control:** Expert use of **Git/GitHub** for branching and release management (Transitioned to **WSL2 Linux Environment** for professional-grade performance).
* **Cross-Browser Engineering:** Extensive experience ensuring pixel-perfect layouts and animation stability across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
* **Deployment:** Automated CI/CD flow using GitHub Pages with custom CNAME integration.
